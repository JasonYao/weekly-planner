% 2019 winter gift for my SO that loves a particular style
% of weekly planners, but is unable to find one exactly the
% way she wants.
%
% This project is completely tailored to the style that she
% prefers, so that she can just go to the website and click
% print.
%
% This is a wrapper class for a "Biweekly Print Version",
% where it shows two weeks on a single page in landscape.
